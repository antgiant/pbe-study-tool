          "One of the outstanding features of the books of Kings is their basic chronological framework.",
          "Two principal items of chronological information are given for each: (1) a synchronism, dating the beginning of the reign of a king of Judah in a specific year of the contemporary king of Israel, and vice versa, and (2) the length of each reign.",
          "However, there are many difficulties in reconciling the figures given for Israel with those of Judah, and in harmonizing both with non-Biblical chronology.",
          "Such difficulties have led some Biblical scholars to conclude that the chronology of the Hebrew kings has become hopelessly confused, through the centuries, because of copyists' errors.",
          "Actually, the seeming discrepancies are due largely, if not altogether, to our lack of information as to the various technical methods of reckoning used in Bible times.",
          "The dates employed in this commentary for convenient reference (see tabulation on p. 77) are derived from chronological systems of the kings based on thorough studies, and are chosen as showing the greatest degree of harmony among the Biblical data and as coming nearest to a complete solution of the problem."

          "A Century earlier Tertullian (died c. 230) spoke of Paul as the \"illuminator\" of Luke, that is, the one who encourage Luke and provided him with much of the information contained in Luke's writings.",

          "The book of Luke is generally considered to be the one of the literary of the NT, and in many respects most nearly like the style of the Greek writers.",
          "Eusebius (ibid) describes Luke as \"by race an Antiochian and a physician by profession.\" He was, presumably, a native of Antioch, and some have thought that it was there that he wrote.",
          "Others have suggested Rome as the place of writing.",
          "The place and manner of Luke's death are unknown, though tradition states that Luke was martyred in Greece, explaining that he was nailed to a living olive tree.",
          "Conservative scholars generally date the book of Luke not later than the year A.D. 63, for the following reason: the book of Luke was apparently written before the book of Acts (see Acts 1:1).",
          "The abrupt ending of the book of Acts is generally considered to be the evidence that the book was written during the time Paul's first imprisonment in Rome, about A.D. 61-63, probably soon after his arrival in that city.",
          "The simplest explanation for the abrupt ending is that Luke told no more in the book of Acts because, at the time, there was no more to tell.",
          "It is extremely unlikely the trial, release, rearrest, conviction and execution of Paul would have been omitted from the record of Acts had these events already taken place at the time of the composition of the book.",
